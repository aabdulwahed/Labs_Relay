## Project Summary
`Stablecoin loans with borderless credit scoring through social attestation.`
  
Enable is a peer-to-peer stablecoin credit marketplace, that allows:

- Borrowers to access global loans marketplace
- Lenders to access funding opportunities globally

This solves a pain point in emerging markets, where loans are difficult to get and often come at high interest rates. This is even though some borrowers have high credit rating and scores.

Enable is a hackathon project that started during the [Ethereal + Consensys Labs Open Finance Hackathon](https://www.buildandship.it/).
