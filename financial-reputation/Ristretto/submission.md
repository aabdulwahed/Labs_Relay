# Submission for the Labs Open Finance Bounties

## Project Name
Ristretto

## Project Summary
Ristretto is a Peer to Peer lending platform where debt is backed by friends, family or people who trust in the borrower. Users can have different roles in the platform, they can be Endorsers, Borrowers or Lenders. In many cases people like coffee farmers have no access to any kind of credit, this is specially important in scenarios where they are forced to sell their cultures, at really low prices, in order to finance the next one and keep the business flowing.
