# Instructions for Submitting Open Finance Bounties

## Step 1
Clone this repo to your desktop.

## Step 2
There are two folders in the repo for each bounty. Open the folder that corresponds with the bounty you are submitting against, and, in that folder, create a new subfolder.

## Step 3
Name the subfolder your project name.

## Step 4
Insert your team's pitch as well as all supporting material (code, research, designs etc) into your project's folder.

There should be a single document (video presentation, PDF, slide deck) that communicates product _and_ potential in a compelling way at the top/root directory of your project's folder. All submissions, including all code, must be open source for future use and reference by the community, and links to external documents must be provided in the Github repo submission.

As a reminder, we are looking for projects that address a real problem and teams that have shown the progress and entrepreneurial instincts to make something real and get it out in the world. Your application should communicate this. _The more compelling the presentation, the better your team does!_

## Step 5
Fill out the submission.md template, included at the top of the bountie's folder with all relevant information.

**This must be included to be considered for the bounty prize.**

## Step 6
Create a pull request with your team's folder submission. Submit it to the repo.
